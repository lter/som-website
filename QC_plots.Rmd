# This workflow harvests html files generated from the
# soilHarmonization::homogenization_QC(), copies those html files from Aurora to
# the docs/qaqc folder of the lter/som-website GitHub repository, and generates
# references to those files as hyperlinks on the QC_plots tab of the project
# website (https://lter.github.io/som-website/QC_plots.html).

# Pivotal to this workflow is the transfer of homogenization output, including
# the html files from Google Drive to the docs/qaqc folder in the project
# repository. This transfer is necessary as the google_drive package is unable
# to read html files directly from Google Drive. At this time, the transfer of
# files/output from Google Drive to the Data-downloads folder on Aurora
# (/home/shares/lter-som/Data-downloads) is a bash process facilitated with
# Rclone (see below).

# rclone sync ltersom:LTER-SOM/Data_downloads Data-downloads
